# Cell Simulator

Software that tests a simple hypothesis, given that Cells are very tiny microorganisms, they probably have minimal intelligence. If they move faster when they are in an area without food, and slow down in the area where there is food, will they reach the area with food an survive?

The simulation can be run with several environments with different food distributions (brighter there is food, darker there is no food), and the histogram represents the concentration of cells among the surface.

# Running

`$ java -cp target/cellsimulator-1.0.jar com.github.marioariasga.cellsimulator.Manager`
